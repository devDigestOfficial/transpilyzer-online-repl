## üíé Transpiling Code Once The User Stops Typing
Without adding a transpilation delay feature in the application, the error message / output is displayed immediately while you are still typing. This is introduces bad User Experience (UX). So to fix this, the debounce method provided by lodash was used. This allows you to execute some code after a certain number of milliseconds has passed. Therefore in this application, the conversion/transpile function is called after 1000 milliseconds (after 1 second has passed) once user stops typing.
